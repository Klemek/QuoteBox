# QuoteTube Beta 1.5
## Description
QuoteTube is a simple soundbox tool in which you can extract a part of any Youtube™ video and play "quotes" (the extracted sound) indefinitely without Internet. QuoteTube doesn't use a server for processing the different steps but will use instead Youtube-dl (through QPython app using) and FFmpeg libs.
